[Reviewer First Name], I sincerely apologize that your experience didn't meet expectations. This isn't the standard we hold ourselves to at Southwest Resume Services.

I'd like to make this right. Please contact me directly at (480) 374-3418 or [email] so we can discuss a resolution.

Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

- Ryan Zimmerman
```

**Template for Unreasonable/Fake Review:**

```
Thank you for your feedback. We take all concerns seriously and have thoroughly reviewed our records. [If you weren't a client: We have no record of providing services to you.] [If complaint is factually incorrect: We'd like to clarify that...]

We're committed to providing exceptional service to all Phoenix-area clients. If you'd like to discuss this further, please contact us directly at (480) 374-3418.

```

**NEVER:**
- ❌ Argue with reviewers publicly
- ❌ Share client confidential information
- ❌ Ask them to remove/edit review (against Google policy)
- ❌ Offer incentives for reviews (also against policy)
- ❌ Ignore negative reviews (respond to everything)

### Review Velocity Targets

| Timeframe | Target Reviews | Cumulative Total |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Current | - | 3 reviews (5.0 stars) |
| Month 1 | 4-5 reviews | 7-8 reviews |
| Month 2 | 4-5 reviews | 11-13 reviews |
| Month 3 | 4-5 reviews | 15-18 reviews |
| Month 6 | 4-5/month avg | 25-30 reviews |
| Month 12 | 3-4/month avg | 40-50 reviews |

**Why This Matters:**
- 25+ reviews = "established" business signal to Google
- 40+ reviews = competitive for "resume writing Phoenix" searches
- Steady velocity (not sudden spikes) = natural and trustworthy

🔍 Did you know 75% of resumes never reach human eyes?

Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) filter resumes before recruiters see them. If your resume isn't optimized, you're invisible.

At Southwest Resume Services, we use O*NET and BLS data to ensure your resume includes the right keywords for your target role - without keyword stuffing.

Phoenix professionals: Don't let robots block your dream job.

🚫 Resume Red Flag: Objective Statements

"Seeking a challenging position where I can utilize my skills..."

NO. Recruiters don't care about YOUR goals. They care about what you can do for THEM.

Replace "Objective" with a "Professional Summary" that highlights:
• Your expertise
• Your value proposition
• Your measurable wins

🔎 LinkedIn Hack: Use the "Skills" Section Strategically

Recruiters search LinkedIn by skills. If you don't list the right ones, you're invisible.

Pro tip: Review 5 job postings for your target role. Note which skills appear in ALL of them. Add those to your LinkedIn (if you truly have them).

Top 3 skills should be your MOST relevant, not most endorsed.

### Post Creation Workflow

**Weekly Routine:**

- Check content calendar
- Adjust for timely topics (news, trends)
- Write/schedule posts

**Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday:** Posts go live
- Monitor engagement
- Respond to comments within 2 hours

**Sunday:** Review analytics (10 min)
- Which posts got most views?
- Which CTA got most clicks?
- Adjust next week's content accordingly

---

### Post Best Practices

**DO:**
- ✅ Use emojis (sparingly - 1-3 per post)
- ✅ Ask questions to drive engagement
- ✅ Include clear call-to-action
- ✅ Tag location when relevant (Phoenix, Scottsdale)
- ✅ Use line breaks for readability
- ✅ Add photos when possible (posts with images get 2x engagement)

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Post promotional content more than 30% of the time
- ❌ Use ALL CAPS (except acronyms)
- ❌ Exceed 1,500 characters (shorter is better)
- ❌ Post more than once per day (looks spammy)
- ❌ Forget to proofread (typos hurt credibility)
