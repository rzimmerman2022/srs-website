   - Primary category: "Resume Services" or "Career Counseling"
   - Don't over-categorize (confuses search engines)
   - Select categories that match actual services

3. **Write Unique Descriptions Where Possible**
   - Some directories detect duplicate content
   - Use the templates but vary sentence structure
   - Keep core keywords consistent: resume writing, career coaching, Phoenix

4. **Upload Photos**
   - Directories with photos rank higher
   - Use consistent branding (logo on all photos)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Inconsistent NAP
**Problem:** Using different variations of business name, phone formats, or addresses
**Impact:** Confuses search engines, dilutes local SEO value
**Solution:** Copy/paste from NAP template every time

**Example of BAD inconsistency:**
- Google: "Southwest Resume Services LLC" | (480) 374-3418
- Yelp: "SRS Resume Services" | 480.374.3418
- BBB: "Southwest Resume Service" | 480-374-3418

**Example of GOOD consistency:**
- All: "Southwest Resume Services" | (480) 374-3418

### 2. Choosing Wrong Categories
**Problem:** Selecting irrelevant categories to appear in more searches
**Impact:** Attracts wrong audience, may violate directory TOS, confuses local SEO
**Solution:** Only choose categories that accurately reflect services

**BAD:** Adding "Restaurant," "Plumber," "Attorney" to appear in more searches
**GOOD:** Stick to Resume Services, Career Counseling, Professional Services, Business Consulting

### 3. Duplicate Listings
**Problem:** Creating new listing when one already exists
**Impact:** Splits reviews and SEO value, confuses customers
**Solution:** Always search for existing listing first, claim and correct instead of creating new

**How to check:**
- Search "[Your Business Name] + [City]" on each platform
- Look for auto-generated listings from data aggregators
- Claim existing listings rather than creating duplicates

### 4. Ignoring Verification
**Problem:** Submitting listing but not completing verification process
**Impact:** Listing may not appear in search results or appears as "unverified"
**Solution:** Complete verification within 48 hours of submission

**Verification methods:**
- Phone (instant - best option)
- Postcard (5-14 days)
- Email (when available)

### 5. Set-It-and-Forget-It
**Problem:** Never updating or monitoring citations after initial submission
**Impact:** Incorrect information, missed reviews, outdated offerings
**Solution:** Review every 6 months, respond to reviews monthly

**Maintenance schedule:**
- Monthly: Check for new reviews on major platforms
- Quarterly: Update any service changes or new offerings
- Bi-annually: Audit all citations for accuracy
- Annually: Add new photos, update descriptions

### 6. Over-Keyword Stuffing
**Problem:** "Phoenix Resume Writer Phoenix AZ Best Resume Services Phoenix Scottsdale"
**Impact:** Looks spammy, may violate TOS, poor user experience
**Solution:** Write naturally, use keywords 2-3 times in 150-word description

**BAD:**
> Phoenix resume services Phoenix AZ resume writer Phoenix resume writing Phoenix Scottsdale resume services Mesa resume writer Phoenix metro resume services

**GOOD:**
> Southwest Resume Services is a professional resume writing and career coaching firm serving Phoenix, Scottsdale, Mesa, and Tempe. We specialize in research-backed career documents...

### 7. No Photos or Low-Quality Photos
**Problem:** Skipping photo uploads or using blurry/unprofessional images
**Impact:** Lower visibility, less trust, poor first impression
**Solution:** Add 5-10 high-quality photos to every major citation

**Photo checklist:**
- Logo (required)
- Cover/header image
- Office exterior (if applicable)
- Work samples (anonymized resume examples)
- Team photo (professional)
- Process photos (consultation, workspace)

### 8. Not Responding to Reviews
**Problem:** Ignoring customer reviews (positive or negative)
**Impact:** Looks unprofessional, loses opportunity to convert readers, damages reputation
**Solution:** Respond to ALL reviews within 48 hours

**Response template (positive):**
> Thank you so much, [Name]! We're thrilled we could help you [specific outcome from review]. Wishing you continued success in your career! - Southwest Resume Services Team

**Response template (negative):**
> Hi [Name], thank you for your feedback. We take all concerns seriously. We'd love to discuss this further and make things right. Please reach out to us directly at info@southwestresumes.com or (480) 374-3418. - Southwest Resume Services Team

## Questions or Issues?

**Common troubleshooting:**

**Q: A directory already has my business listed but the info is wrong.**
A: DO NOT create a new listing. Claim the existing listing and correct the information. Look for "Claim this business" or "Is this your business?" links.

**Q: A directory requires a street address but I don't want to publish it.**
A: Use "Phoenix, AZ Metro Area" or your service area. Some directories allow "Service Area Business" designation (check Google Business Profile settings for SAB).

**Q: Should I pay for premium/enhanced listings?**
A: Focus on free listings first. Only upgrade on platforms where you're getting significant traffic (check your Google Analytics referrals after 3 months).

**Q: How do I know if a citation is working?**
A: After 2-4 weeks, search for your business name on Google. Your citations should start appearing in search results. Use Google Search Console to monitor.

**Q: What if I find duplicate listings?**
A: Claim both, merge if possible, or contact directory support to remove the duplicate. Keep the one with the most complete information.

**Q: Should I use Southwest Resume Services LLC or Southwest Resume Services?**
A: Use "Southwest Resume Services" unless the directory specifically requires legal entity name. Consistency matters more than including LLC.
