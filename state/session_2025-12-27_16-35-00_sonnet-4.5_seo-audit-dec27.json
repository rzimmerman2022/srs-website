    "problem_understanding": "Owner requested multi-agentic audit to optimize website for conversion, specifically to make homepage hero copy achieve immediate 'YES' response. Session evolved to comprehensive site audit with strategic decision framework due to discovery that optimization tactics depend on business model (volume vs premium).",
    "attempted_solutions": [
      "Initial hero copy rewrite - scored 65/100 by QA agent",
      "Refined hero copy with owner feedback - emphasized human expertise without specific names",
      "Comprehensive 15-page website audit - initial score 81/100",
      "Chain-of-Verification to find missed issues - revised score to 76/100, found 15 gaps",

      "Proximity Problem: Most professionals undersell themselves not from modesty but because expertise becomes invisible when you're living it - this resonates viscerally",

      "Generic optimization paradox: A 95/100 'perfectly optimized' site may generate less revenue than a 60/100 differentiated site if brand becomes generic",
      "Sitemap generation is dynamic in Next.js 15 - don't search for static XML file, test runtime endpoint",
      "Schema markup at 100% coverage is rare (industry average 30%) - strong competitive advantage already exists",
      "Location pages follow persona patterns: Phoenix (general), Scottsdale (executive), Mesa (technical), Tempe (ASU/young pro)",

    "dead_ends": [
      "Attempted to add Ryan + Jordyn names to homepage hero - owner clarified wanted general 'our team' language, not specific names",

      "Considered removing 'Southwest Resume Services' from subtitle to optimize character count - QA agent identified this loses service clarity, critical gap",
