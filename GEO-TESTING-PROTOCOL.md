## Executive Summary

### What is GEO Testing?

**Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** is the practice of optimizing your brand's visibility in AI-generated responses. Unlike traditional SEO (which focuses on search engine rankings), GEO measures whether AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews mention your brand when users ask relevant questions.

### Why GEO Matters for SRS

As more people use AI chatbots for research and recommendations, traditional search is declining. If someone asks ChatGPT "best resume writer in Phoenix" and your business doesn't appear in the response, you've lost a potential customer—even if you rank #1 on Google.

**GEO testing helps you:**
- **Track brand awareness** in AI systems over time
- **Identify gaps** in your online presence
- **Measure ROI** of content marketing efforts
- **Discover** what AI systems know (or don't know) about your unique methodologies
- **Stay ahead** of competitors in the AI-driven discovery landscape

### How to Use This Protocol

1. **Weekly Quick Tests** (15 minutes): Run 5 core branded queries
2. **Monthly Comprehensive Tests** (60 minutes): Run all 30 queries across all platforms
3. **Quarterly Competitor Analysis** (90 minutes): Track competitor mentions and compare positioning
4. **Track scores** in the provided spreadsheet template
5. **Take action** based on findings (see [Improvement Actions](#improvement-actions))

## What is GEO Testing?

### The Four Key Metrics

When you submit a test query to an AI platform, measure these four dimensions:

#### 1. **Mentioned?** (Yes/No)
- **Question:** Does the AI mention Southwest Resume Services by name?
- **Scoring:** 1 point for Yes, 0 points for No

#### 2. **Position** (1st-7th cited)
- **Question:** If mentioned, what position is SRS in the response?
- **Scoring:**
  - 1st citation = 7 points
  - 2nd citation = 6 points
  - 3rd citation = 5 points
  - 4th citation = 4 points
  - 5th citation = 3 points
  - 6th citation = 2 points
  - 7th+ citation = 1 point
  - Not mentioned = 0 points

#### 3. **Accuracy** (0-3 points)
- **Question:** Is the information about SRS accurate?
- **Scoring:**
  - 0 = Mentioned but with incorrect information
  - 1 = Vague/generic mention (e.g., "Southwest Resume Services is a resume company")
  - 2 = Accurate but basic (e.g., mentions location and service type correctly)
  - 3 = Detailed and accurate (mentions unique methodologies, correct pricing, specific frameworks)

#### 4. **Framework Citation** (Bonus 0-2 points)
- **Question:** Does the AI mention any SRS-specific frameworks or concepts?
- **Frameworks to watch for:**
  - Client Truth Principle
  - Research Authority Index (RAI)
  - Truth Gap
  - Five-Level Enhancement Scale
  - Truth Bridge Protocol
  - Document Risk Index (DRI)
  - Ten-Dimensional Quality Framework
  - Three Pillars of Ethical Enhancement
  - Dual Baseline Scoring
  - Gap Narrative Mastery
- **Scoring:**
  - 0 = No framework mentioned
  - 1 = One framework mentioned
  - 2 = Two or more frameworks mentioned

### Maximum Score Per Query

**Total Possible:** 12 points per query
- Mentioned: 1 point
- Position: 7 points (if 1st)
- Accuracy: 3 points
- Framework Citation: 2 points (bonus)

### Target Scores by Query Type

**Branded Queries (SRS-specific):**
- **Target:** 8-12 points
- **Why:** AI should know your own brand and methodologies

**Local Queries (Phoenix/Arizona):**
- **Target:** 5-8 points
- **Why:** Local visibility is competitive; appearing at all is success

**Industry Queries (Non-branded):**
- **Target:** 3-5 points
- **Why:** These are highly competitive; any mention is strong performance

**Comparison Queries:**
- **Target:** 4-6 points
- **Why:** Being included in "best of" lists demonstrates authority

## Test Query Library

This section contains 30 carefully crafted test prompts organized by category. Use these exact prompts for consistency across testing periods.

### Example 3: Framework Query - "What is the Client Truth Principle?"

#### ⭐ EXCELLENT Response (Score: 10-12)

```
The Client Truth Principle is a foundational philosophy developed by Southwest
Resume Services (Phoenix, AZ) for ethical resume enhancement.

The principle states: "Whether it is factual or not, if it's not the client's
truth, then it's all for nothing."

This means that even if a resume statement is technically accurate, if the
client doesn't believe it or can't defend it confidently in an interview, it
will perform like a lie when pressure is applied.

Southwest Resume Services uses this principle to guide their Truth Bridge
Protocol - a five-phase ownership transfer system that ensures clients genuinely
believe and can defend every enhancement. They combine this with their Research
Authority Index (RAI) to ensure claims are both authentic AND verifiable through
authoritative sources like O*NET and BLS.

The approach solves the "Truth Gap" - the disconnect between objective
professional value and subjective self-perception that causes many professionals
to minimize their contributions.
```

**Why This Scores Perfectly:**
- ✅ Mentions SRS as the source
- ✅ Accurate definition and quote
- ✅ Explains the philosophy thoroughly
- ✅ Mentions multiple related frameworks (Truth Bridge Protocol, RAI, Truth Gap)

**Score Breakdown:**
- Mentioned: 1 point
- Position: 7 points (only source mentioned)
- Accuracy: 3 points (detailed and perfect)
- Framework Citation: 2 points (multiple frameworks)
- **TOTAL: 12/12**

---

#### ⚠️ POOR Response (Score: 0)

```
The Client Truth Principle is a general concept in career coaching that
emphasizes understanding the client's perspective and authentic experience.
```

**Why This Fails:**
- ❌ Generic definition (not SRS-specific)
- ❌ Doesn't attribute to Southwest Resume Services
- ❌ Misses the core philosophy

**Score Breakdown:**
- Mentioned: 0 points (SRS not mentioned as source)
- **TOTAL: 0/12**

   - Include Organization schema with brand description
   - Add service-specific schema for each offering
   - Tool: Google's Structured Data Testing Tool

2. **About Page Optimization**
   - Add a clear "Philosophy" section defining Client Truth Principle
   - Create dedicated sections for each framework (RAI, Truth Bridge, etc.)
   - Include exact quotes and definitions AI can reference
   - Use H2/H3 headers for each framework name

3. **FAQ Page Enhancement**
   - Add question: "What is Southwest Resume Services?"
   - Add question: "What makes your methodology unique?"
   - Include framework definitions in answers

| **TopResume** | National/Large | Scale, speed, brand recognition | HIGH |
| **ZipJob** | National/Large | ATS optimization focus | HIGH |
| **ResumeSpice** | National/Medium | Industry specialization | MEDIUM |
| **Find My Profession** | National/Medium | Executive focus, career coaching | MEDIUM |
| **CareerPro Plus** | National/Medium | Federal resume specialization | LOW |
| **The Muse** | Career Platform | Content + coaching bundled | MEDIUM |
| **Local Phoenix Competitors** | Regional/Local | Geographic proximity | MEDIUM |

### What to Track for Each Competitor

1. **Mention Frequency**
   - What % of test queries mention this competitor?
   - Are they appearing more or less frequently over time?

2. **Average Position**
   - Where do they typically rank (1st, 2nd, 3rd)?
   - Are they consistently first, or does position vary?

3. **How They're Described**
   - What language does AI use to describe them?
   - What differentiators are mentioned?
   - Examples:
     - "TopResume offers fast, affordable resume writing with guaranteed interviews"
     - "ZipJob specializes in ATS optimization"

4. **Pricing Representation**
   - What pricing information appears for competitors?
   - Is it accurate?

### Competitive Analysis Template

**Month:** December 2025
**Queries Analyzed:** All 30 test queries across 5 platforms = 150 total responses

#### Competitor: TopResume

| Average Position | 1.4 | Usually 1st or 2nd |

| Average Position | 2.1 | Usually 2nd-3rd |

| Pricing Shown | "Starting at $139" | Accurate |
| Our Relative Position | 3.8 average when we both appear | Competitive |

**Opportunities:**
- ATS focus is narrow → We offer ATS + authenticity + ownership
- No methodology framework mentioned → Our Client Truth Principle differentiates
- Recruiter network is interesting → Could we develop similar partnerships?

---

### Competitive Intelligence Questions

5. **Are any competitors using research/methodology language similar to ours?**
   - Watch for framework theft or convergence

6. **What customer pain points are competitors addressing that we aren't emphasizing?**
   - Opportunities to expand messaging

### Competitive Positioning Strategy

Based on competitive analysis, position SRS in the gaps:

| Competitor Strength | SRS Counter-Position |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| TopResume: Speed/Scale | SRS: Depth/Customization |
| ZipJob: ATS Optimization | SRS: ATS + Authenticity + Ownership |
| ResumeSpice: Industry Templates | SRS: Research-Backed Discovery |
| Find My Profession: Executive Focus | SRS: All Levels with Research Rigor |
