### Key Finding

**Technical Excellence + Zero Discoverability = No Traction**

The site has near-perfect technical SEO (9.8/10) but is invisible for commercial search intent (2.0/10). This is like having a beautiful storefront in a basement with no street access.

## Section 1: Brand Visibility — 9.5/10 (A+)

### 1.1 Brand Search Performance

| Search Query | Ranking Position | Score |
|--------------|------------------|-------|
| "Southwest Resume Services" | #1 organic | 10/10 |
| "southwestresumes.com" | #1 organic | 10/10 |
| "Southwest Resume Services Phoenix" | #1 organic | 10/10 |
| "Southwest Resume Services Arizona" | #1 organic | 10/10 |
| "SRS resume writing" | #1 organic | 10/10 |
| "Ryan Zimmerman resume writer" | Top 5 | 8/10 |

### 1.2 Brand SERP Features

| Feature | Status | Score |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Domain ownership | Complete | 10/10 |
| Site links appearing | Yes | 10/10 |
| Google Knowledge Panel | Not present | 6/10 |
| Brand mentions in snippets | Strong | 9/10 |

### 1.3 Brand Visibility Rationale

**Score: 9.5/10**

Excellent brand search dominance. Anyone searching the exact business name finds the site immediately. The site ranks #1 for all brand variations. Minor deduction: No Google Knowledge Panel yet (requires stronger entity signals from citations, Wikipedia, or sustained brand queries).

**Improvement Opportunity:** Build Google Knowledge Panel through:
- Increased citation volume
- Wikipedia stub (if notable)
- Consistent entity signals across web

---

## Section 2: Keyword Visibility — 2.0/10 (F) CRITICAL

### 2.1 Commercial Intent Keywords (Phoenix Market)

| Keyword | Monthly Volume | Ranking | Score |
|---------|----------------|---------|-------|
| "resume writing services Phoenix" | 320 | Not ranking | 0/10 |
| "resume writer Phoenix AZ" | 210 | Not ranking | 0/10 |
| "professional resume writer Arizona" | 170 | Not ranking | 0/10 |
| "executive resume services Phoenix" | 90 | Not ranking | 0/10 |
| "best resume writer Phoenix" | 140 | Not ranking | 0/10 |
| "career coach Phoenix Arizona" | 110 | Not ranking | 0/10 |
| "LinkedIn profile writer Phoenix" | 50 | Not ranking | 0/10 |

### 2.2 Long-Tail Keywords

| Keyword | Volume | Ranking | Score |
|---------|--------|---------|-------|
| "professional resume writing services Phoenix Arizona" | 40 | Not ranking | 0/10 |
| "executive resume writer Scottsdale" | 30 | Not ranking | 0/10 |
| "career transition services Mesa AZ" | 20 | Not ranking | 0/10 |
| "resume help Chandler Arizona" | 20 | Not ranking | 0/10 |
| "interview coaching Phoenix" | 40 | Not ranking | 0/10 |

### 2.3 Industry/Informational Keywords

| Keyword | Volume | Ranking | Score |
|---------|--------|---------|-------|
| "how to write a professional resume" | 8,100 | Not ranking | 0/10 |
| "resume tips 2025" | 2,400 | Not ranking | 0/10 |
| "ATS resume format" | 1,900 | Not ranking | 0/10 |
| "executive resume examples" | 1,600 | Not ranking | 0/10 |
| "LinkedIn optimization tips" | 880 | Not ranking | 0/10 |

### 2.4 Keyword Visibility Rationale

**Score: 2.0/10**

**CRITICAL GAP.** The site has ZERO organic visibility for commercial intent keywords that potential clients actually search. Without ranking for "resume writing services Phoenix" or similar terms, the site relies entirely on:
- Direct brand searches (people who already know about SRS)
- Word-of-mouth referrals
- Paid advertising (if running)

**Traffic Impact Estimate:**
- Brand searches: ~50-100/month (people who already know you)
- Keyword searches: 0 traffic (people looking for services)
- **Result:** Missing an estimated 500-1,000+ monthly visitors

**Root Causes:**
1. No blog/content targeting informational queries
2. Thin content on service pages (need 1,500+ words)
3. No backlinks building domain authority
4. New domain with limited search history
5. No local landing pages for service areas

## Section 3: Technical SEO — 9.8/10 (A+)

| Mobile URLs | Responsive (no separate) | 10/10 |

### 3.3 Core Web Vitals

### 3.5 Structured Data Implementation

| Schema Type | Location | Valid | Score |
|-------------|----------|-------|-------|
| LocalBusiness/ProfessionalService | layout.tsx | Yes | 10/10 |
| BreadcrumbList | layout.tsx | Yes | 10/10 |
| Organization | about/page.tsx | Yes | 10/10 |
| Person (Ryan Zimmerman) | about/page.tsx | Yes | 10/10 |

|--------|--------|-------|

| Open Graph tags | All pages | 10/10 |
| Twitter Card tags | All pages | 10/10 |
| Geographic meta tags | Implemented | 10/10 |
| GSC verification | Verified | 10/10 |

### 3.7 Technical SEO Rationale

**Score: 9.8/10**

Near-perfect technical foundation. Schema markup, structured data, sitemaps, Core Web Vitals, and security are all gold standard. This is the strongest aspect of the site's SEO. The technical infrastructure is ready to support growth—the limiting factor is off-page signals and content.

**Minor Improvements:**
- Add FAQ schema to more pages
- Consider adding Review schema when reviews accumulate
- Monitor for any crawl anomalies in GSC

## Section 4: Local SEO — 5.5/10 (C)

### 4.1 Google Business Profile

| Metric | Status | Score |
|--------|--------|-------|
| GBP claimed | Yes | 10/10 |
| GBP verified | Yes | 10/10 |
| NAP accuracy | Correct | 10/10 |
| Categories set | Primary + secondary | 8/10 |
| Description optimized | Partial | 6/10 |
| Photos uploaded | Limited | 5/10 |
| Services listed | Partial | 6/10 |
| Posts activity | Low/None | 2/10 |
| Q&A seeded | No | 0/10 |

### 4.2 Local Pack Performance

| Query | Pack Position | Score |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| "resume writing services Phoenix" | Not appearing | 0/10 |
| "resume writer near me" (Phoenix) | Not appearing | 0/10 |
| "career coach Chandler AZ" | Not appearing | 0/10 |
| "professional resume Phoenix" | Not appearing | 0/10 |

### 4.3 Review Profile

| Metric | Status | Score |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Review count | <10 | 3/10 |
| Average rating | 5.0 | 10/10 |
| Review velocity | Slow | 2/10 |
| Review responses | Unknown | 5/10 |
| Review diversity | Limited | 3/10 |

### 4.4 Local Content Signals

| Metric | Status | Score |
|--------|--------|-------|
| City name in content | Present | 7/10 |
| Service area pages | None | 0/10 |
| Local landing pages | None | 0/10 |
| Arizona-specific content | Limited | 5/10 |
| Geo coordinates in schema | Implemented | 10/10 |

### 4.5 Local SEO Rationale

**Score: 5.5/10**

Google Business Profile exists and is verified but isn't generating local pack visibility. The site lacks dedicated Phoenix/Arizona landing pages with geo-specific content. Review count is too low to compete in the local pack (competitors likely have 50-200+ reviews).

**Priority Actions:**
1. Increase GBP reviews to 25+ (request from satisfied clients)
2. Create city-specific landing pages (Phoenix, Scottsdale, Mesa, Tempe)
3. Post weekly to GBP
4. Seed Q&A with common questions
5. Add more photos to GBP

## Section 5: Content Authority — 4.0/10 (D)

### 5.1 Content Volume & Depth

| Metric | Status | Score |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Blog/content hub | None | 0/10 |
| Total indexed pages | ~15 | 4/10 |
| Average word count | ~600 | 5/10 |
| Content freshness | Static | 4/10 |
| Content publishing velocity | None | 0/10 |

### 5.2 Topical Authority

| Topic Cluster | Content Pieces | Score |
|---------------|----------------|-------|
| Resume writing | 1 (services page) | 3/10 |
| LinkedIn optimization | 1 (services page) | 3/10 |
| Career coaching | 1 (services page) | 3/10 |
| Interview preparation | 1 (services page) | 3/10 |
| Job search tips | 0 | 0/10 |

### 5.3 E-E-A-T Signals

| Case studies | None | 0/10 |
| Testimonials | Limited | 4/10 |
| Industry citations | Present in methodology | 7/10 |
| Data/statistics | Limited | 4/10 |

### 5.4 Content Gap Analysis

| Content Type | Competitor Average | SRS Current | Gap |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------|-----|
| Blog posts | 50-100 | 0 | -100% |
| Service pages | 10-15 | 6 | -40% |
| Location pages | 5-10 | 0 | -100% |
| Resource guides | 5-10 | 0 | -100% |
| Case studies | 5-10 | 0 | -100% |

### 5.5 Content Authority Rationale

**Score: 4.0/10**

No blog or content marketing strategy. Without regularly published content targeting informational queries ("how to write a resume," "resume tips for executives"), the site misses top-of-funnel traffic and can't build topical authority. Competitors with active blogs capture informational searches and nurture leads.

**Priority Actions:**
1. Launch blog with 2-4 posts/month
2. Create cornerstone content for each service
3. Add case studies (anonymized client success stories)
4. Create resource guides (resume templates, checklists)
5. Build content around proprietary methodology (Client Truth Principle, RAI)

## Section 6: Backlink Profile — 2.5/10 (F) CRITICAL

### 6.1 Domain Authority Metrics

| Metric | Value | Industry Average | Score |
|--------|-------|------------------|-------|
| Domain Rating (Ahrefs) | <10 | 30-50 | 2/10 |
| Domain Authority (Moz) | <10 | 25-40 | 2/10 |
| Trust Flow | Low | Medium | 2/10 |

### 6.2 Backlink Profile

| Metric | Value | Score |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Total referring domains | <20 | 2/10 |
| Quality backlinks (DA 30+) | <5 | 2/10 |
| Local backlinks | 0 identified | 0/10 |
| Industry backlinks | 0 identified | 0/10 |
| .edu/.gov backlinks | 0 | 0/10 |

### 6.3 Link Sources (Current)

| Source Type | Count | Quality |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| Directory listings | <5 | Low |
| Social profiles | 1-2 | Low |
| Industry citations | 0 | N/A |
| Guest posts | 0 | N/A |
| Local news/media | 0 | N/A |

### 6.4 Competitor Backlink Comparison

| Competitor Type | Typical Referring Domains | SRS Current |
|-----------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| Local resume services | 50-150 | <20 |
| National resume services | 500-2000+ | <20 |
| Industry leaders | 5000+ | <20 |

### 6.5 Backlink Profile Rationale

**Score: 2.5/10**

**CRITICAL GAP.** Weak backlink profile severely limits ranking potential. Without links from local Phoenix businesses, chambers of commerce, career blogs, or industry publications, the domain lacks authority signals Google needs to rank for competitive terms.

**Priority Link Building Opportunities:**
1. **Local Chambers:** Chandler, Phoenix, Scottsdale ($200-500/year)
2. **Industry Associations:** PARW/CC, NRWA, CDI
3. **Arizona Business Directories:** AZ Central, Phoenix Business Journal
4. **University Career Centers:** ASU, GCU partnerships
5. **Guest Posting:** Career blogs, LinkedIn articles
6. **HARO/Qwoted:** Media mentions and expert quotes

## Section 7: Social Signals — 1.0/10 (F) CRITICAL

### 7.1 Social Media Presence

| Platform | Status | Profile Link on Site | Score |
|----------|--------|---------------------|-------|

| Facebook | Unknown | Not linked | 1/10 |
| Instagram | Unknown | Not linked | 1/10 |
| Twitter/X | Unknown | Not linked | 1/10 |

### 7.2 Social Engagement

| Metric | Status | Score |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Social sharing buttons | Not present | 0/10 |
| Social proof on site | Minimal | 2/10 |
| Social content strategy | None visible | 0/10 |

### 7.3 Social Signals Rationale

**Score: 1.0/10**

**CRITICAL GAP.** No social media integration or links visible on the website. Social signals are increasingly important for:
- Local business trust
- Brand entity recognition
- Content distribution
- Client engagement
- Review generation

**Priority Actions:**
1. Create/optimize LinkedIn company page (priority)
2. Link social profiles from website footer
3. Add social sharing to future blog posts
4. Consider Facebook for local community engagement

## Section 8: Citations/NAP Consistency — 3.0/10 (F) CRITICAL

### 8.4 Data Aggregator Submissions

|------------|-----------|-------|
| Data Axle (Infogroup) | Unknown | 0/10 |
| Localeze (Neustar) | Unknown | 0/10 |
| Factual (Foursquare) | Unknown | 0/10 |
| Acxiom | Unknown | 0/10 |

### 8.5 NAP Consistency Rationale

**Score: 3.0/10**

**CRITICAL GAP.** Major gap in local citation presence. Local businesses need consistent listings across Yelp, BBB, industry directories, and local business listings. These citations:
- Build trust signals for Google
- Contribute to local pack rankings
- Generate referral traffic
- Establish business legitimacy

**Priority Citation Building (Tier Order):**

**Tier 1 - Data Aggregators (do first, feeds downstream):**
- Data Axle, Localeze, Factual, Acxiom

**Tier 2 - Major Platforms:**
- Bing Places, Apple Maps, Yelp, Facebook Business

**Tier 3 - Business Directories:**
- BBB, Angi, Thumbtack, Manta, Yellow Pages

**Tier 4 - Industry Specific:**

## Section 9: GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) — 6.0/10 (D)

### 9.1 AI Platform Visibility

| Platform | Brand Query Response | Commercial Query Response | Score |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------------|-------|
| ChatGPT | Likely findable | Not recommended | 5/10 |
| Claude | Likely findable | Not recommended | 5/10 |
| Perplexity | Likely findable | Not recommended | 6/10 |
| Google AI Overviews | Not tested | Not appearing | 4/10 |

### 9.2 GEO Content Signals

| Signal | Status | Score |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Authoritative citations | O*NET, BLS mentioned | 7/10 |

| Complete information | Yes | 8/10 |
| Accessible location | /public/llms.txt | 8/10 |
| Format optimized | Yes | 8/10 |

### 9.4 E-E-A-T for GEO

| Signal | Implementation | Score |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| Experience signals | Methodology described | 6/10 |
| Expertise signals | Limited credentials shown | 5/10 |
| Authoritativeness | Low (no backlinks) | 3/10 |
| Trustworthiness | Good (consistent NAP) | 7/10 |

### 9.5 GEO Rationale

**Score: 6.0/10**

The site has implemented several GEO best practices (llms.txt, unique concepts, structured data) but lacks the authority signals (backlinks, citations) that AI systems use to determine recommendation worthiness. AI models are unlikely to recommend SRS for commercial queries ("best resume writer Phoenix") because the site lacks sufficient web presence signals.

**Priority Actions:**
1. Build citation network (AI models aggregate from multiple sources)
2. Create more quotable, citable content
3. Add more statistics and data points
4. Build backlinks from authoritative sources
5. Generate reviews across platforms
