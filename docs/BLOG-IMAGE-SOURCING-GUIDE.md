## Implementation Instructions

### Step 1: Download Images

For each image URL above:
1. Visit the Unsplash URL
2. Click "Download free" (creates `unsplash` folder in Downloads)
3. Rename file to descriptive name:
   - Format: `post-{number}-img-{number}-{keyword}.jpg`
   - Example: `post-1-img-1-resume-desk-laptop.jpg`

### Step 2: Optimize Images

Before adding to project:
```bash
# Install ImageMagick (if not installed)
brew install imagemagick

# Optimize each image (reduces file size, maintains quality)
magick convert input.jpg -quality 85 -resize 1200x output.jpg
```

**Target specs:**
- Max width: 1200px
- Quality: 85%
- Format: JPG (smallest file size for photos)
- Est. file size: 100-300KB each

### Step 3: Add to Project

```bash
# Create images directory
mkdir -p public/images/blog

# Move optimized images
mv ~/Downloads/optimized/*.jpg public/images/blog/
```

### Step 4: Update Blog Posts

In `lib/blog/posts.ts`, modify content HTML to include images:

**Example insertion:**
```html
<p>Here's what actually works—based on what we see getting results for Phoenix professionals.</p>

<img src="/images/blog/post-1-img-1-resume-desk-laptop.jpg" alt="Professional reviewing modern resume at desk with laptop and coffee" class="blog-image" />

<div class="callout-box">
```

### Step 5: Add Image Styling

In `app/globals.css`, add:

```css
.blog-content img.blog-image {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 800px;
  height: auto;
  margin: 2rem auto;
  display: block;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
