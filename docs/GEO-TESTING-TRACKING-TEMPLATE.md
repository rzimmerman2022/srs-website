## Gap Analysis & Action Items

After each weekly test, identify queries where score was < 7 and note optimization actions:

| Query | Current Score | Gap Identified | Optimization Action | Implemented |
|-------|---------------|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
|       |               |                |                     | [ ]         |
|       |               |                |                     | [ ]         |
|       |               |                |                     | [ ]         |

## Expected Progression

| Week | Expected Score | Rationale |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| **Week 1 (Baseline)** | 30-60 / 300 (10-20%) | Before GEO optimization, minimal AI visibility |
| **Week 4** | 90-120 / 300 (30-40%) | After llms.txt in place + initial citations |
| **Week 12** | 150-210 / 300 (50-70%) | After 30+ citations + content optimization |
| **Week 24** | 210-270 / 300 (70-90%) | Mature GEO presence, consistent citations |

---

## Notes

- **First run establishes baseline** - don't expect high scores initially
- **Focus on trend, not absolute numbers** - improvement over time is the goal
- **Use low-scoring queries to guide content optimization** - if query #7 scores 0, add more "research-based" content to llms.txt
- **Platform differences are normal** - Perplexity often scores highest due to real-time web search
