## Key Decisions Made This Session

| Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered | Reversibility |

| Apply CoVe protocol for QA | Catch issues missed by initial audit | Standard review | Easy |
| Add Contrarian analysis | Challenge assumptions, avoid groupthink | Skip contrarian view | Easy |
| Keep "Southwest Resume Services" in subtitle | Service clarity > meta tag optimization | Remove for character count | Easy |
| General "human team" language vs names | About page has names; homepage stays general | Add "Ryan and Jordyn" to homepage | Easy |
| Three strategic paths (A/B/C) | Owner needs options based on business model | Prescribe single path | Moderate |
| Commit to staging, NOT main | Owner explicitly requested safety | Commit directly to main | N/A (prevented) |
