## Executive Summary

This session completed a comprehensive multi-agentic website audit and strategic analysis for Southwest Resume Services. The work included:

1. **Contrarian Strategic Analysis** (967 lines) - Challenges conventional wisdom about AI disruption in resume services; identifies trust/verification as key differentiator
2. **Website Audit** (15 pages scored) - Overall score 76/100 after CoVe verification
3. **Hero Copy Optimization** - New homepage hero emphasizing "human-led, research-backed" positioning
4. **Blog Typography Fixes** - Installed @tailwindcss/typography, fixed list bullets, added TableOfContents
5. **Documentation** - 12+ files created for AI handoff continuity

**Key Finding:** SRS's "Client Truth Principle" positions it well for a post-AI job market where verification matters more than generation.

**Owner Decision Required:** Choose Path A (Volume), B (Premium), or C (Hybrid) based on business model.

## Critical Warnings

### 1. DO NOT MERGE TO MAIN WITHOUT OWNER APPROVAL
The staging branch contains significant changes including:
- New homepage hero copy (positioning change)
- Strategic analysis with business implications
- Blog typography changes

Owner must review before production deployment.

### 2. Vercel Auto-Deploys from Main
Any push to `main` triggers automatic Vercel deployment. Only merge after explicit approval.

### 3. "Fiction" vs "Friction" - Intentional Differences
The codebase has two different uses:
- **"friction"** - Used in Client Truth Principle quote: "A resume you can't own performs like friction when it matters most"
- **"fiction"** - Used elsewhere intentionally: "not crafting fiction", "without crossing into fiction"

Do NOT "fix" all instances of "fiction" - only the CTP quote should use "friction".

### 4. Staging/Prototype Directories Outdated
The `/staging/` and `/prototype/` directories contain old copies with the wrong "fiction" wording. These are not production code but could cause confusion.

## Continuation Checklist

### For Next AI Session

1. **Read State File First**
   ```bash
   cat state/session_2025-12-27_18-45-52_Opus-4.5.json | jq '.cognitive_context'
   ```

2. **Check Owner Decisions**
   - Did owner choose Path A, B, or C?
   - Is hero copy approved for production?
   - Any feedback on contrarian analysis?

3. **Verify Branch State**
   ```bash
   git checkout staging/seo-content-drafts
   git pull origin staging/seo-content-drafts
   git log --oneline -5
   ```

4. **Resume From Continuation Plan**
   - See `continuation_plan.immediate_tasks` in state JSON
   - Check `blocked_items` for dependencies

### For Owner Review

1. **Read the Contrarian Analysis**
   - Focus on "Evidence-Backed Contrarian Views" section
   - Review "Actionable Recommendations" for near-term priorities

2. **View Hero Copy**
   - Start dev server: `npm run dev`
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - Evaluate new hero section

3. **Choose Strategic Path**
   - See `docs/SYNTHESIS-COVE-CONTRARIAN-2025.md`
   - Path A: Volume optimization
   - Path B: Premium differentiation
   - Path C: Hybrid measurement-first
