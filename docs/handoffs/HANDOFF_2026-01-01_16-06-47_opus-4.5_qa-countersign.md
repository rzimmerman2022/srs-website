# Handoff Document: QA Countersign Session

**Session ID:** `qa-countersign`
**Date:** 2026-01-01
**Model:** Claude Opus 4.5
**Status:** COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

This session completed the QA verification of the lead capture configuration work. A multi-agent SDA SOP workflow audited all 26 documentation files, discovered and fixed critical security issues (exposed Supabase credentials), and verified all documentation is properly organized with 1:1 mapping.

**Key Outcome:** All documentation verified, security issues resolved, ready for production monitoring.

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Multi-Agent Documentation Audit

Ran parallel agents to audit:
- All 26 files in `docs/` directory
- README.md integration references
- CHANGELOG.md session entries
- Cross-file consistency

### 2. Security Fixes (CRITICAL)

| Issue | File | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| Exposed Supabase token | `docs/SUPABASE-AI-AUTOMATION.md` | Replaced with placeholder |
| Exposed database password | `docs/SUPABASE-AI-AUTOMATION.md` | Replaced with placeholder |
| Exposed token (duplicate) | `docs/handoffs/HANDOFF_2025-12-27_*.md` | Replaced with placeholder |

**WARNING:** These credentials were in git history. User should rotate:
- Supabase access token (`sbp_...`)
- Supabase database password

### 3. Documentation Updates

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `README.md` | Added Integrations section with Quick Reference table |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Added Session 5 entry (2026-01-01 lead capture) |
| `docs/INTEGRATIONS-MASTER-REFERENCE.md` | Added Documentation Map section |

### 4. QA COVE Countersign

| Claim | Result |
|-------|--------|
| README.md Integrations section | PASS |
| CHANGELOG.md Session 5 entry | PASS |
| Documentation Map exists | PASS |
| No exposed credentials | PASS |
| Cross-references verified | PASS |

**Overall Confidence:** 100%

## Reproduction Instructions

### Environment Setup

```bash
cd "/Users/ryanzimmerman/MACBOOK - Projects/SRS - Website"
git pull origin main
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Verify Documentation

```bash
# Check all referenced files exist
ls docs/ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLES.md
ls docs/INTEGRATIONS-MASTER-REFERENCE.md
ls docs/HUBSPOT-INTEGRATION.md
ls docs/SUPABASE-AI-AUTOMATION.md

# Verify no credentials exposed
grep -r "sbp_72569a60" docs/ || echo "CLEAN"
grep -r "REDACTED_PASSWORD" docs/ || echo "CLEAN"
```

### Verify Integration IDs

| Service | ID | Check Command |
|---------|-----|---------------|
| Google Analytics | `G-BZDVNW58WQ` | `grep -r "G-BZDVNW58WQ" README.md` |
| HubSpot Portal | `243166647` | `grep -r "243166647" README.md` |
| Formspree | `xaqnnbpp` | `grep -r "xaqnnbpp" components/` |
| Supabase | `aougseszcvzgxwniossn` | `grep -r "aougseszcvzgxwniossn" lib/` |

## Critical Warnings

### 1. Credential Rotation Required

The following credentials were exposed in git history:

```
Supabase Access Token: REDACTED_SUPABASE_TOKEN
Database Password: REDACTED_DB_PASSWORD
```

**User MUST rotate these credentials:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Account
2. Regenerate access token
3. Go to Settings → Database → Reset password
4. Update `.env.local` with new values
5. Update Vercel environment variables

### 2. Git History Contains Secrets

Even though credentials are removed from files, they exist in git history. Consider:
- Using `git filter-branch` to remove from history
- Or accept the risk and ensure tokens are rotated

2. **If doing other work:**
   - Use `docs/INTEGRATIONS-MASTER-REFERENCE.md` as starting point
   - Check Documentation Map for where things are located
   - All integration IDs are in README.md Quick Reference

3. **If security-related:**
   - Confirm user rotated Supabase credentials
   - Check no new credential exposures introduced
