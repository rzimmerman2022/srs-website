## 2. Objectives & Outcomes

### Objective

Run SDA SOP multi-agent workflow with QA subagent to:
1. Verify all documentation is properly updated
2. Ensure README and changelog point correctly
3. Map all APIs/tokens to documentation
4. Organize all documentation 1:1 from README

### Outcomes

| Objective | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Multi-agent documentation audit | COMPLETED | Explored 26 docs files |
| Security credential audit | COMPLETED | Found and fixed 2 exposed tokens |
| README integration references | COMPLETED | Added Integrations section |
| CHANGELOG session entry | COMPLETED | Session 5 documented |
| API/token mapping | COMPLETED | Documentation Map added |
| QA COVE countersign | COMPLETED | 100% confidence |

### Deviations from Plan

- **Security Issue Found**: Multi-agent audit discovered CRITICAL exposed Supabase credentials
- **Additional Fixes Required**: Had to remove `sbp_72569a60...` token and `REDACTED_DB_PASSWORD` password from docs

---

## 3. Technical Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Add Documentation Map to INTEGRATIONS-MASTER-REFERENCE.md

**Rationale:** Rather than create a separate mapping document, consolidate into the existing master reference to maintain single source of truth.

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Single file to maintain
- Pro: All integration info in one place
- Con: File grows larger

**Alternatives Rejected:**
- Separate `DOCUMENTATION-MAP.md` file (would create duplication)
- Add mapping to README (too detailed for overview document)

### Decision 2: Remove Exposed Credentials vs Rotate

**Rationale:** Removed exposed credentials and replaced with placeholders. Recommended user rotate tokens separately.

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Immediate security improvement
- Con: Doesn't force rotation (user responsibility)

**Confidence:** 0.95
**Reversibility:** Easy (placeholders can be replaced)

## 4. Code Changes

### Files Modified

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/SUPABASE-AI-AUTOMATION.md` | Removed exposed Supabase access token and database password |
| `docs/handoffs/HANDOFF_2025-12-27_18-45-52_Opus-4.5_contrarian-analysis.md` | Removed exposed token |
| `README.md` | Added Integrations section with quick reference and documentation links |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Added Session 5 entry for lead capture configuration |
| `docs/INTEGRATIONS-MASTER-REFERENCE.md` | Added Documentation Map section |

### New Dependencies Added

None

### Breaking Changes Introduced

None

## 5. Testing & Validation

### QA COVE Verification Results

| Claim | Result | Confidence |
|-------|--------|------------|
| README.md Integrations section exists | PASS | 100% |
| CHANGELOG.md Session 5 entry exists | PASS | 100% |
| Documentation Map in INTEGRATIONS-MASTER-REFERENCE.md | PASS | 100% |
| No exposed credentials in docs | PASS | 100% |
| Cross-reference file verification | PASS | 100% |

### Security Verification

| Pattern | Files Checked | Matches Found |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| `REDACTED_SUPABASE_TOKEN` | All docs/ | 0 (PASS) |
| `REDACTED_PASSWORD` | All docs/ | 0 (PASS) |
| `sbp_72569a60` (partial) | All docs/ | 0 (PASS) |

## 6. Knowledge Gained

### Insights About the Codebase

1. **Documentation Structure**: Project has comprehensive docs/ directory with handoffs, audits, and reference files
2. **Multi-Agent Pattern**: SDA SOP workflow with specialized agents (Explore, QA COVE, Contrarian) is effective for audits
3. **Credential Management**: `.env.local` is properly gitignored; documentation should only contain placeholders

### Gotchas Discovered

1. **Credential Exposure in Handoffs**: Easy to accidentally paste real credentials in handoff documents
2. **Linter Modifications**: Markdown linter auto-formats tables (not an error, just cosmetic)

### Patterns Identified

1. **Documentation Hierarchy**: README → INTEGRATIONS-MASTER-REFERENCE → Service-specific docs → Handoffs
2. **Verification Chain**: Multi-agent audit → Fixes → QA COVE countersign → Commit

---

## 7. Obstacles & Blockers

### Resolved Issues

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Exposed Supabase token | Replaced with placeholder |
| Exposed database password | Replaced with placeholder |
| Missing README integration references | Added Integrations section |

### Unresolved Issues

None

### External Dependencies

- Vercel deployment (automatic on push to main)
- User should rotate exposed Supabase credentials

---

## 8. Context Preservation

### State Serialization

- **File**: `state/session_2026-01-01_16-06-47_opus-4.5_qa-countersign.json`
- **Purpose**: Cognitive context for next AI session

### Knowledge Base Updates

- Documentation Map added to INTEGRATIONS-MASTER-REFERENCE.md
- This pattern should be followed for future integration additions

### Links to Past Sessions

- **Previous**: `HANDOFF_2026-01-01_22-45-00_opus-4.5_lead-capture-complete.md`
- **Related**: `HANDOFF_2025-12-27_18-45-52_Opus-4.5_contrarian-analysis.md`

---

## 9. Next Session Setup

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Rotate Supabase Credentials** (USER ACTION)
   ```bash
   # Go to Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Account
   # Regenerate access token
   # Update .env.local with new token
   ```

2. **Verify Vercel Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Check https://southwestresumes.com loads correctly
   # Submit test form and verify email arrives at info@southwestresumes.com
   ```

3. **Monitor Lead Capture**
   - Check Google Analytics for traffic
   - Check HubSpot for new contacts
   - Check Formspree dashboard for submissions

### Prerequisites for Continuation

- All changes already pushed to main
- Vercel auto-deployment triggered
- No pending commits or staged changes

### Time Estimates

| Task | Estimate |
|------|----------|
| Supabase credential rotation | 5 min |
| Deployment verification | 5 min |
| First lead monitoring | Ongoing |

## Summary

This session completed the QA countersign verification requested by the user. The multi-agent audit discovered critical security issues (exposed Supabase credentials) which were immediately fixed. All documentation is now properly organized with 1:1 mapping from README to detailed docs.

**Key Metrics:**
- Files Modified: 5
- Security Issues Fixed: 2 (credential exposures)
- QA COVE Confidence: 100%
- All Changes: Committed and Pushed to Main
