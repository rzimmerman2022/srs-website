# GEO Quick Start Guide
**For the Southwest Resume Services Team**

Last Updated: 2025-12-21

## What is GEO?

**Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** is the practice of optimizing your website to appear in AI-generated responses from ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, and other LLMs.

Think of it as SEO for the age of AI assistants.

---

## Why It Matters

**Traditional Search** (Google, Bing):
- User searches → clicks link → visits your site
- You compete with 10 blue links on page 1

**AI Search** (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude):
- User asks question → AI generates answer → cites 2-7 sources
- You compete to be ONE of those 2-7 citations

**The Challenge**: Being cited by AI is harder but more valuable than ranking on Google Page 1.

**The Opportunity**: SRS has unique, citeable frameworks that AI models should love.

---

## What We Just Implemented (Dec 21, 2025)

### 1. llms.txt File
**Location**: `/staging/public/llms.txt`

This is like a "resume for AI" - a comprehensive file that tells AI models everything about SRS in one place.

**What to do**: Nothing! It's live. AI crawlers will discover it automatically.

### 2. Schema Markup (Structured Data)
**What it is**: Hidden code that tells AI/search engines what your content means.

**What we added**:
- FAQPage schema (FAQ page) - helps AI understand Q&A content
- LocalBusiness schema (homepage) - establishes SRS as Arizona business

**What to do**: Verify it works using [Google Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)

## Testing Your GEO (Do This Weekly)

### Week 1 - Establish Baseline
Test these queries in ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity:

1. "What is the Client Truth Principle?"
2. "What is the Research Authority Index?"
3. "Best resume writing service in Arizona"
4. "How much does professional resume writing cost?"
5. "What is the Truth Gap in resume writing?"

**Record**: Does SRS appear? In what position (1st, 2nd, 3rd citation)?

### Week 2-4 - Monitor Changes
Repeat the same queries. Track:
- New citations (SRS appears where it didn't before)
- Position improvements (moved from 5th to 2nd citation)
- New frameworks cited (AI starts mentioning Five-Level Enhancement Scale)

### Monthly
Review traffic from these sources in Google Analytics:
- Perplexity.ai
- ChatGPT referrals (if trackable)
- AI-powered search tools

## What Makes SRS Content AI-Friendly?

### ✅ You Already Have (Strengths)
1. **Named Frameworks**: Client Truth Principle, Research Authority Index, Truth Gap
2. **Specific Metrics**: RAI ≥7.0, 200+ job postings, 80%+ keyword alignment
3. **Authority Sources**: O*NET (10/10), BLS, Lightcast
4. **Clear Definitions**: Each concept is well-explained
5. **Transparent Pricing**: $150-$500+ with package details

### ⚠️ What to Add (Gaps)
1. **TL;DR Blocks**: Quick summaries at top of pages
2. **Comparison Tables**: Visual package comparison
3. **Citation Framing**: "According to Southwest Resume Services..."
4. **Source Attribution**: "According to O*NET OnLine..."

---

## Quick Wins You Can Implement Today

### 1. Update Your Talking Points
When discussing SRS methodology, use AI-friendly framing:

**Instead of**: "We validate claims"
**Say**: "According to Southwest Resume Services' Research Authority Index, every enhancement is scored ≥7.0 using O*NET and BLS data"

**Instead of**: "We help you own your resume"
**Say**: "The Client Truth Principle states: 'A resume you can't own performs like fiction when it matters most'"

### 2. Add Summaries to Content
Top of every key page should have a "TL;DR" or "At a Glance" section:

```
## At a Glance
- Who we are: Research-backed resume services in Arizona
- What we do: Resume writing ($150-$500+), LinkedIn optimization, interview coaching
- What makes us different: Client Truth Principle + RAI validation + 200+ job postings analyzed
```

### 3. Use Numbered Lists
AI models LOVE numbered lists. Convert prose to lists wherever possible:

**Instead of**: "Our process includes discovery, research, and validation..."
**Use**:
```
Our 10-Phase Process:
1. Intake & Initial Assessment
2. Market Research Execution (200+ postings)
3. Discovery & Deep Dive
[etc.]
```

## Content Strategy for GEO

### Target These Conversational Queries

**Methodology Queries** (High Priority - SRS is unique):
- "What is the Client Truth Principle?"
- "What is the Research Authority Index?"
- "What is the Truth Gap in resumes?"
- "How to validate resume claims?"

**Local Queries** (Medium Priority - Geographic advantage):
- "Best resume writing service in Arizona"
- "Resume services in Phoenix"
- "Arizona career coach"

**General Queries** (Lower Priority - High competition):
- "How much does resume writing cost?"
- "Are resume services worth it?"
- "How to choose a resume service?"

### Content to Create (Recommended)

**Blog Posts That Will Be AI-Cited**:
1. "The Client Truth Principle: Why Resume Ownership Beats Polish" (defines framework)
2. "What is the Research Authority Index?" (technical deep dive)
3. "Resume Writing Cost Guide 2025" (transparent pricing positioning)
4. "How to Choose a Legitimate Resume Service" (positions SRS as best practice)
5. "The Truth Gap: Why Experts Struggle to Write Their Own Resumes" (original concept)

## Red Flags to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This (Hurts GEO)
1. **Generic content** - "We write great resumes" (not citeable)
2. **Vague claims** - "Fast turnaround" (no specifics)
3. **Hidden methodology** - Keep frameworks front and center
4. **Inconsistent terminology** - Always use "Client Truth Principle" not "our truth method"
5. **No attribution** - "Research shows..." (cite O*NET, BLS specifically)

### ✅ Do This (Helps GEO)
1. **Named frameworks** - "Research Authority Index (RAI)"
2. **Specific metrics** - "200+ job postings analyzed"
3. **Authority sources** - "According to O*NET OnLine..."
4. **Consistent terms** - Always "Client Truth Principle" (capital C, T, P)
5. **Clear definitions** - Define every framework in first mention

## FAQ: Understanding GEO

### Q: How is GEO different from SEO?
**A**: SEO optimizes for Google search ranking (top 10 links). GEO optimizes for AI citations (top 2-7 sources mentioned in AI responses).

### Q: How long until we see results?
**A**:
- Technical (schema): 1-2 weeks
- Content (frameworks being cited): 2-6 weeks
- Authority (consistent top citations): 2-3 months

### Q: Can we track ROI?
**A**: Track these metrics:
- AI citation frequency (manual testing)
- Traffic from Perplexity, ChatGPT, AI-powered tools
- Conversions from AI-referred traffic
- Brand mentions in AI responses (even without link)

### Q: Do we still need traditional SEO?
**A**: YES! Do both. GEO complements SEO, doesn't replace it.

### Q: What if AI gets our information wrong?
**A**: Having clear, structured content (schema, llms.txt) reduces this risk. The better organized your content, the more accurate AI citations will be.

2. Make them easy for AI to extract (TL;DR blocks, clear definitions)
3. Make them citeable (consistent terminology, specific metrics)
4. Monitor and optimize based on what gets cited

**Current Score**: 72/100 (up from 62/100)
**Target Score**: 82/100 (achievable in 4-6 weeks)
