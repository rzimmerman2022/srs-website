**File ID:** 01_SDA_SOP_Master_Report_Generation_v1.0\_\[YYYY-MM-DD\]
**Date Created:** \[YYYY-MM-DD\] **Author:** \[Author Name\]
**Subject:** Standard Operating Procedure for the creation of the final,
client-facing HTML Meta-Analysis Synthesis Report.

**1.0 Document Purpose and Scope**

This SOP outlines the structure and required content for the final
01_SDA_Report\_\[ClientLastNameFirstName\]\_Meta_Analysis deliverable.
This is the capstone document of the client workflow, synthesizing all
findings from the preceding 02, 03, and 04 documents into a
comprehensive, professional report.

Adherence to this template is mandatory to ensure consistency, quality,
and clarity across all client deliverables. The content within this SOP
is the direct template for the HTML file and should be populated using
the specific findings for each client.

- Perplexity AI Deep Research

**Disclosure and Methodology Statement:**

- **Transparency Note:** This comprehensive review was conducted using
  advanced AI research platforms to synthesize current evidence on
  \[client\'s primary issue, e.g., exercise-induced hypertension\] in
  the context of \[client\'s key factors, e.g., testosterone replacement
  therapy and sports supplementation\]. The methodology involved:

  - Systematic queries across multiple AI research platforms (GPT-5,
    Claude Opus 4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Perplexity AI)

  - Cross-validation and triangulation of findings across platforms

  - Iterative fact-checking and verification of primary sources

  - Synthesis using world-class prompting techniques and data analytics
    best practices

  - Multiple rounds of review and refinement to ensure accuracy

- **Note:** This is not a PROSPERO-registered systematic review or
  formal meta-analysis, but rather a comprehensive AI-assisted
  literature synthesis designed to provide clinicians and researchers
  with an up-to-date evidence summary.
