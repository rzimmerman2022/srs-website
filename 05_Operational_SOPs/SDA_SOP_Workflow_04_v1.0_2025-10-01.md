**Standard Operating Procedure: Workflow 04**

**Document Type: Client Profile**

**Client Profile: \[ClientLastNameFirstName\]**

**Date:** \[YYYY-MM-DD\]

**Case File:** \[Brief Description of Case, e.g., Sudden Onset
Hypertensive Crisis Analysis\]

**Presenting Problem & Clinical Context**

**Client:** The client, \[Client Name\], is experiencing \[describe the
primary problem\].

**Chief Complaint:** \[Quote or summarize the client\'s main complaint
in their own words.\]

**Frequency:** \[e.g., Five episodes within the last nine days.\]

**Peak Recorded Value:** \[e.g., 156/96 mmHg (Stage 2 Hypertension).\]

**Recent Medical Evaluation:** \[e.g., Visited the ER, where a CT scan
was performed.\]

**Key Finding:** \[e.g., The CT scan ruled out a brain aneurysm. Other
lab work was presumably clear.\]

**Current Medical Status & Intervention**

**Prescribed Medication:** \[e.g., Clonidine HCl 0.1 mg (10-day
supply).\]

**Medication Efficacy:** \[e.g., The medication has proven effective,
lowering the client\'s BP to a post-dose reading of 127/87 mmHg.\]

**Reported Side Effects:** \[e.g., The client reports feeling
\"sluggish\" and \"kinda\" like a \"zombie\".\]

**Client\'s Action Plan:** \[e.g., Ceasing all caffeine intake,
monitoring BP 2-3 times per day, and scheduling a follow-up appointment
with his primary physician.\]

**Key Variables for Analysis**

The client\'s supplement and medication regimen is the primary focus,
particularly recent changes.

**Primary Variable: \[Description of Primary Change\]**

*This is the most significant recent variable.*

**Current Item (Suspected Contributor):** \[e.g., Unmatched EH2K
Pre-Workout\]

**Previous Item:** \[e.g., Kaged Pre-Workout\]

**Secondary Variables: Other Recent Supplement/Medication Changes**

**Item 1:** \[e.g., Switched to Unmatched Cregaatine.\]

**Item 2:** \[e.g., Introduced Unmatched Dileucine (peptide amino
acid).\]

**Stable Lifestyle & Supplement Factors**

These factors have been consistent for an extended period (e.g., \>1
year) and serve as a baseline.

**Long-term Protocol:** \[e.g., TRT (Testosterone Replacement Therapy):
Dose has been stable for one year.\]

**Foundational Supplements (Long-term use):**

- \[e.g., Protein: Kaged Whey Protein Isolate\]

- \[e.g., Multivitamin: Animal Pak\]

- \[e.g., Fatty Acids: Animal Advanced Omega\]

- \[List other long-term, stable factors\]

**Scope of Research for SparkData Analytics**

**1. Comparative Ingredient Analysis:** Conduct a deep-dive comparison
of the ingredient profiles of the current \[Suspected Contributor\] and
the previous \[Previous Item\]. Identify differences in compounds known
to affect the client\'s symptoms.

**2. Interaction Modeling:** Research the mechanisms of action for all
new items and model their potential dynamic interplay with each other
and with the client\'s stable protocols.

**3. Identify Potential Causative Agents:** Isolate specific ingredients
or combinations in the new regimen that are documented to have effects
related to the chief complaint.

**Deliverable:** Provide the client with a comprehensive data summary
(per 02_SDA_Analysis SOP) to support their \"own due diligence\" and to
facilitate a more granular, data-driven discussion with their medical
team regarding potential causes and treatment adjustments.
