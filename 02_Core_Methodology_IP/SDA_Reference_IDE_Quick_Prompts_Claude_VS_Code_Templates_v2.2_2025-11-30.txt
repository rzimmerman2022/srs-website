  🚀  HOW TO START YOUR DAY (5-Step Daily Workflow)
1. Pick tier (T0–T3) → paste Risk Tier Declaration
2. Run Builder prompt (#1)
3. New chat → Reviewer / Verification / lenses per tier
4. Save outputs to the right evidence files
5. Update DECISION_*.json and push

  🎯  SHORTCUTS BY RISK TIER
Tier
Required Prompts / Shortcuts
T0
"Build this" only (review optional)
T1
"Build this" + "Review this" (new chat!)
T2
"Build this" + "Review this" + "Verify T2/T3" + at least 1 lens
For pipelines: "Data quality" lens required
T3
All of the above + "Security check" + "Perf check" + "Maintain check" + "Resilience check"
+ "Compare models" + "Challenge this" (if agreement >80%)

  📋  WHAT TO PASTE (AND WHAT NOT TO)
❌  DON'T PASTE
✅  DO PASTE
	•	Prior chat logs
	•	"Here's what I did" prose from Builder
	•	Screenshots of reasoning
	•	Summaries from other agents
	•	Verbal claims about test results
	•	Requirement / spec / ticket text
	•	Actual diff or file contents
	•	Test output from terminal
	•	Lint / type-check results
	•	Coverage report numbers
⚠️ Why this matters: Reviewers who see Builder explanations will just summarize them instead of independently verifying the code. This defeats the entire purpose of multi-agent review.

  ⚠️  BEFORE USING ANY PROMPT
Step 1: Determine Risk Tier (T0/T1/T2/T3) per SOP §1.2. If unsure, choose the higher tier.
Step 2: Paste the Risk Tier Declaration so the agent sees context:
## Risk Tier Declaration
**Tier:** [T0 | T1 | T2 | T3]
**Justification:** [Why this tier]
**Required Controls:** [List from §1.2.2]
Step 3: Use ONLY the prompts below for T1-T3 changes. Free-form prompts are NOT allowed.

  🚫  HARD RULE: FRESH CHAT SEPARATION
⛔ If a chat has ever used Builder Mode (#1) in it, you may NOT use Reviewer (#2), Verification (#3), or any Lens prompts (#4-10) in the same chat. Start a new chat.
This is non-negotiable. Mixing roles in the same chat defeats the entire purpose of independent verification.
Recommended Convention: Name your chat windows with role prefixes:
	•	[B] Feature X implementation
	•	[R] Feature X review
	•	[V] Feature X verification

  🏢  APPROVED MODEL FAMILIES FOR T3
For T3 (Critical) work, use at least 2 distinct model families across your agents:
Family
Models
Recommended For
Anthropic
Claude Opus 4, Claude Sonnet 4, Claude Haiku 4
Planning, Code Review, Security Review
OpenAI
GPT-5 Codex, GPT-4o, o1-pro
Implementation, Performance Review
Google
Gemini 2.0 Pro, Gemini 2.0 Ultra
Alternative perspective, Resilience Review
Meta
Llama 3.1 405B (if self-hosted)
Secondary verification
T3 Minimum Requirement: Builder and at least one Verification/Lens agent MUST use different model families.

  🤖  INLINE AI (AUTOCOMPLETE) POLICY
For T2/T3 work, any AI-generated code (including inline suggestions from Copilot, Cursor autocomplete, etc.) must still be put through:
	•	A Builder Mode pass over the final diff, AND
	•	The appropriate Reviewer / Verification / Lens prompts before merge
Autocomplete is allowed, but it never bypasses the multi-agent quality gate.

  🔧  1. BUILDER MODE (Implement Change + Tests)
	•	When to use: Any time you're changing code (T0-T3)
	•	Risk Tier: All tiers
	•	Inputs needed: Tier declaration + Spec/ticket + selected file(s)
Prompt:
You are the **Builder Agent** for SparkData Analytics.
 
## METADATA (fill in):
- Model: [your model name/version]
- Date/Time (UTC): [current timestamp]
- Risk Tier: [T0 | T1 | T2 | T3]
- Session ID: [unique identifier]
 
## RISK TIER DECLARATION:
[PASTE: tier declaration from above]
 
## SPEC (requirement):
[PASTE: ticket / acceptance criteria / 2-10 lines max]
 
## CODE CONTEXT:
[The IDE already shows the file or diff]
 
## Your Tasks:
1. Implement the **minimal** code changes needed to satisfy the SPEC
2. Add or update tests to cover:
   - Main happy paths
   - Edge cases and invalid inputs
   - Any non-functional requirements (perf/security/logging) if in SPEC
3. Keep changes **small and focused** - do NOT refactor unrelated code
 
## Constraints:
- Follow existing patterns and style in this repo
- Do NOT evaluate or "approve" your own work - a separate reviewer will audit it
- Do NOT change public APIs unless SPEC clearly requires it
- For T2/T3: Ensure tests are comprehensive enough to catch regressions
 
## Output Format:
 
### Metadata Block
```
Model: [name/version]
Timestamp: [ISO-8601 UTC]
Risk Tier: [T0-T3]
Session ID: [ID]
```
 
### Implementation
1. A single ```diff``` block with the proposed patch
 
### Summary (max 5 bullets):
- What changed and why
- What tests you added/updated
- Any assumptions you made
- For T2/T3: Explicitly list edge cases covered by tests

  🔍  2. REVIEWER MODE (Adversarial Review - Blind)
	•	When to use: T1/T2/T3 changes for code review
	•	Risk Tier: T1 minimum, required for T2/T3
	•	⚠️ CRITICAL: Start a fresh chat - do NOT include Builder's explanation
	•	Inputs needed: Tier declaration + Spec + diff + tool results (from terminal)
Prompt:
You are the **Adversarial Reviewer Agent** for SparkData Analytics.
 
## METADATA (fill in):
- Model: [your model name/version]
- Date/Time (UTC): [current timestamp]
- Risk Tier: [T0 | T1 | T2 | T3]
- Session ID: [unique identifier]
 
Your job is to independently review this code change using a skeptical, proof-driven mindset.
 
## RISK TIER DECLARATION:
[PASTE: tier declaration]
 
## SPEC:
[PASTE: requirement or key parts of plan]
 
## CODE DIFF:
[PASTE: git diff output or relevant file sections]
 
## TOOL RESULTS:
[PASTE: e.g., "tests: 152 passed; coverage 82%→85%; lint clean; mypy clean"]
 
You do **NOT** see any explanation from the original author.
 
## Tasks:
 
### 1. Checklist Review
For each item, mark **Pass / Fail / Unclear** and justify briefly:
- [ ] Correctness vs SPEC
- [ ] Edge cases & error handling
- [ ] Test quality (coverage + meaningfulness)
- [ ] Security / data-integrity concerns
- [ ] Performance / complexity concerns
- [ ] Consistency with project patterns
- [ ] Logging / observability
- [ ] Backwards compatibility
 
### 2. Risk Score
- Overall Risk Score: **0-10** (0=minimal, 10=extremely risky)
- Explain in 2-5 sentences, citing SPEC, CODE, and TOOL RESULTS
 
### 3. Required Changes
- If Risk > 2: List numbered REQUIRED changes
  - "[Priority: High/Med/Low] – [Concrete change] – [Why]"
  - **⚠️ At least one REQUIRED change must be either:**
    - (a) A new/updated test, OR
    - (b) Additional logging/metrics
    - Unless you explicitly explain why tests/logging are already sufficient
- If Risk ≤ 2: Explain what you verified and why acceptable
 
## Constraints:
- Do NOT summarize what the code does - author knows that
- Do NOT be polite or vague - be specific and concrete
- Identify at least 3 issues OR explain why fewer than 3 exist
- Do NOT restate other reviewers' findings; focus on NEW issues or deeper evidence
 
## Output Format:
 
### Metadata Block
```
Model: [name/version]
Timestamp: [ISO-8601 UTC]
Risk Tier: [T0-T3]
Session ID: [ID]
Review Type: Adversarial Review (Blind)
```
 
### Checklist
[Pass/Fail/Unclear + justification for each]
 
### Risk Score
[0-10] + explanation
 
### Required Changes
[Numbered list with priorities]
 
### Verdict
[APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES / BLOCK]

  🚫  Free-Form Prompts Policy
For T1-T3 changes: Free-form prompts are NOT allowed.
All IDE-based AI usage for code must use ONLY the prompts in this document. This ensures:
	•	Consistent quality controls
	•	Audit trail compatibility
	•	Compliance with AICPA/EU AI Act/PCAOB requirements
For T0 changes: Free-form prompts are acceptable but discouraged.

  🔮  FUTURE AUTOMATION NOTE
The agreement measurement for Devil's Advocate trigger (>80% overlap AND risk spread <1) is currently manual. Future roadmap includes:
	•	Automated PERSPECTIVE_*.md parsing to extract issues and risk scores
	•	Similarity computation (Jaccard on issue tuples, cosine on embeddings)
	•	Auto-trigger script that spawns Devil's Advocate when threshold met
For now, manually compare reviewer outputs and invoke Devil's Advocate (#8) when agreement seems suspiciously high.
